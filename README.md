Hi All!

Classification is a machine learning task that involves predicting categorical class labels for new instances by learning from a dataset with input features and corresponding labels. The main aim is to develop a model that can learn patterns from the training data and effectively predict class labels for new, unseen data.

We will use several classification algorithms to predict how likely customers are going to purchase a new car, which can be a highly valuable and effective approach, given the right circumstances and data quality. In this case, we will run experiments using 6 algorithms:

1. Logistic Regression
2. SVC
3. KNN
4. DecisionTree
5. RandomForest
6. ExtraTrees

Some of the techniques we will be using include:

1. Data preparation/cleaning
2. Feature engineering
3. Regularization (L1/L2)
4. Hyperparameter tuning
5. Automated hyperparameter tuning
6. Features importance

The experiments are broken down into 6 python notebooks, each notebook will use 1 algorithm containing its own data cleaning, data preparation, feature engineering, training, testing processes.

We will use CRISP-DM framework to provide a more structured approach to tackle this project, properly documents every step taken and stay focused and organized on our objectives throughout the process.

Six major phases of CRISP-DM:

1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Modelling
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment
